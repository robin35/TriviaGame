YOU DON’T KNOW “THIS”??? DALLAS EDITION

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project is a short quiz on little known facts about Dallas, Texas. 

Here’s how to play the game:

    	The game has 4 questions about Dallas, Texas.
    	You will have 30 seconds to answer the question.  The seconds are displayed on a timer that decrements each second.
    	The objective is to select the correct answer before the timer expires.
    	Three events can happen:
        -	The timer expires:  In this case, the correct answer is automatically displayed.
        -	You guess the incorrect answer:  In this case, the correct answer is also automatically displayed.
        -	You guess the correct answer:  You are congratulated.
    	In all three cases, a fact tidbit is displayed giving you a little detail on the correct answer and the screen automatically displays the next question in 15 seconds.
    	After all the questions are answered, a Summary screen shows how many questions you answered correctly, incorrectly, and didn’t answer
    	The Summary screen also has a button to restart the game.

This project targets anyone who is interested in Dallas History.
